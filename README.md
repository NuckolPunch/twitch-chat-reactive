# Chat Reactive Overlay for Twitch
A lightweight browser-based Twitch chat reactive PNG overlay for OBS.  
Switches between an idle image and talking animation when chat messages arrive.
---
## Available Overlay Versions
### 1) Original (chat_react.html)
Supports only `idle` and one `reacting` image with the inclusion of `duration` and `speed`
### 2) Full Featured (chat_reactive_advanced.html)  
Supports all parameters including special question/exclaim reactions, animation speed, random mode, talk delay, etc.  
Best for advanced customization.
### 3) Simple (chat_reactive_simple.html)  
Supports: `idle`, `reacting`, `duration`, `speed`, `random`  
No special reactions (`question` or `exclaim`). Easier URLs and setup.
### 4) Minimal (chat_reactive_minimal.html)  
Supports only `idle` and one `reacting` image (no animation, no timing params).  
Good for beginners or quick testing.

- Use direct PNG links (ending in `.png`).  
- Imgur example: right-click image â†’ Copy Image Address (not page URL).  
- Users should host and supply their own images to customize fully.
